The module 2 challenge is to intend to help us to understand how the stock market works.

Create a script that loops through all the stocks for each quarter and outputs the following information:

The ticker symbol

Quarterly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given quarter to the closing price at the end of that quarter.

The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given quarter to the closing price at the end of that quarter.
Add functionality to the script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume".
